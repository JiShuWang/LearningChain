      a. Choosing the transaction arrival rate dataset
  
      b. Training the transaction arrival rate prediction model
  
      c. Predicting the transaction arrival rate
  
### 2) [Learning-Based Blockchain Performance Prediction Model](https://github.com/JiShuWang/LearningChain/tree/main/BlockchainPerformancePrediction)

      a. Choosing the blockchain performance dataset
 
      b. Training the blockchain performance prediction model

      c. Predicting the blockchain performance
  
### 3) [Blockchain Performance Scoring Optimization Mechanism](https://github.com/JiShuWang/LearningChain/tree/main/ScoringOptimization)

      a. Inputing the predicted transaction arrival rate and the predicted blockchain performance

      b. Scoring and optimization

      c. Adjusting the blockchain parameters corresponds to the best score
