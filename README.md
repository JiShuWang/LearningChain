# LearningChain: A Highly Scalable and Applicable Learning-Based Blockchain Performance Optimization Framework
A blockchain performance predicition model based on machine learning, and a blockchain performance optimization framework. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management.
## Dataset: HFBTP
To make it easier to demonstrate the management of HFBTP, we have made it publicly available on Kaggle, please move to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loveffc/hfbtp-a-blockchain-performance-dataset/data. We performed a detailed and comprehensive data analysis and aggregation of this dataset to demonstrate its value, usability and scalability in different aspects.
